# Axie Infinity
Load and display recently listed Axies in discord channel. I've seen a lot of people having trouble with Axie Infinity market since it doesn't provide any API documentation so I decided to create a simple bot that does all the work. The only request I could find was one with GraphQL that filters out recently listed Axies with POST request.
