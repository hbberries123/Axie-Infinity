# Axie Infinity
Load and display recently listed Axies in discord channel. I've seen a lot of people having trouble with Axie Infinity market since it doesn't provide any API documentation so I decided to create a simple bot that does all the work. The only request I could find was one with GraphQL that filters out recently listed Axies with POST request.

  You can filter out Axies with slash command by their price, abilities and body parts.  Bot will refresh and find new Axies every 5 seconds and send it in provided discord channel.
